# Dream Kite

A web-based game where players fly a kite through surreal, procedurally generated 3D dreamscapes. Built for the Vibe Coding Game Jam.

## Overview

**Dream Kite** is a physics-based kite flying simulation set in ever-changing surreal environments. Navigate through floating islands, glowing forests, and upside-down cities while collecting "dream sparks" to extend your kite's string and increase your score.

## How to Play

### Controls

- **Desktop**:
  - Mouse: Click and drag to pull string (up/down/left/right)
  - Keyboard: Arrow keys to tug the string in different directions

- **Mobile**:
  - Virtual joystick: Drag to adjust string tension and direction

### Gameplay

1. Keep your kite flying as long as possible
2. Collect dream sparks to repair and extend your kite's string
3. Avoid obstacles that can damage your string
4. Balance string tension - too tight will snap it, too loose will cause a crash
5. Experience new dreamscapes as you progress
